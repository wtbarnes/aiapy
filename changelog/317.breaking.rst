`aiapy.calibrate.prep.register` now uses `reproject` for image registration instead of `scipy.ndimage.affine_transform`.
This change means that the full resolution inputs are always returned as 4096 x 4096 pixels
and that cutouts of level 1 images can be passed to this function.
However, it may also lead to slightly longer processing times in most cases.
